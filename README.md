# Math 50 (Linear Models)


## About the course


 **Instructor**:
 The course is taught by me, <a href = "www.github.io/elevien"> Ethan Levien</a>. I'm an assistent professor in the Mathematics department here at Dartmouth.  
 **Meeting time**: TBD

 **Meeting time**: You will learn how to build, implement and interpret linear regression models. Such models form the basis of almost all widely used data analysis techniques, including machine learning algorithms.


## Course policies

**Attendence**: The course meets twice a week and attendence is mandatory. I plan to devote a signficant amount of class time to open ended discussions and group work, so their really isn't any point in taking the course if you don't plan to consistently attend lectures.

**Grading**:
 Your grade will be based on the following assigments:
  <ul>
    <li> python notebooks (50%) - you will work through about 10 or so python notebooks.  </li>
    <li> project proposal (10%)  </li>
    <li> final project (20%) - a final project  </li>
  </ul>

  </p>


## Accessibility Needs
<p> Students with disabilities who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services for this course are encouraged to see me privately as early in the term as possible. Students requiring disability- related academic adjustments and services must consult the Student Accessibility Services office (Carson Hall, Suite 125, 646-9900). Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to me. As a first step, if students have questions about whether they qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.  </p>


## Resources

**Textbooks**: <a href ="https://github.com/avehtari/ROS-Examples"> Regression and other stories </a>. Copies are on reserve at the Library.

**Software**: All coding can be done using python in <a href ="colab.research.google.com"> colab notebooks</a>.
